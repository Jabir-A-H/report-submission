# Project Simplification Notes for Report Submission System

**Context:** The Report Submission System is a Flask-based web app for 20 - 30 users (zone members and admins) to manage educational reports with seven sections (Header, Courses, Organizational, Personal, Meetings, Extras, Comments) across multiple periods (monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, nine-month, yearly). The app must support Bengali localization, mobile-first UI, and PDF and Excel exports. Given the small user base, the implementation should avoid overkill while meeting the UI requirements in TODO_4.md.

**Streamlined Approach:**
  - Keep app.py monolithic; avoid splitting into models.py, routes.py, etc., to reduce maintenance.
  - Use SQLite exclusively (instance/reports.db) for simplicity, as it’s sufficient for low concurrency.
  - Include minimal dependencies in requirements.txt
  - Use Tailwind CDN for styling instead of local build tools to avoid extra setup.
  - Store all templates in the default templates/ folder and static files in static/ for Flask auto-discovery.
  - Rely on Flask’s built-in session and authentication for user management; avoid external auth libraries unless needed.
  - Use Jinja2 template inheritance for consistent layout (base.html).
  - Implement client-side validation with HTML5 and minimal JS; keep JS logic simple and focused.
  - For Bengali localization, hardcode labels/messages in templates and JS, avoiding complex i18n libraries.
  - Use Flask’s send_file for exports; avoid heavy reporting libraries, but include pandas and reportlab for Excel/PDF generation.
  - Document all endpoints and UI flows in README for easy onboarding.
  - Implement autosave for report sections (AJAX + /autosave endpoint).
  - Add export/download endpoints using send_file for Excel/PDF.
  - Allow admin to change user zones from the admin panel.


# Report at a glance Logic (`/report` and `/city_report`)

## Logic for different report types for both users and admins
- For মাসিক reports, include detailed data for the selected month.
- For ত্রৈমাসিক reports, aggregate data from the first three months of the year.
- For ষান্মাসিক reports, aggregate data from the first six months.
- For নয়-মাসিক reports, aggregate data from the first nine months.
- For বার্ষিক reports, include data from all twelve months.

## Logic for adding up zone reports to make the main report for admin
*Exact summary logic is to be added.*


# Report Types

## রিপোর্টের ধরণ (Report Types)
- মাসিক
- ত্রৈমাসিক
- ষান্মাসিক
- নয়-মাসিক
- বার্ষিক

**Selection Logic:**
- If মাসিক is selected, the user chooses a month from the dropdown.
- If ত্রৈমাসিক is selected, the summary covers জানুয়ারি, ফেব্রুয়ারি, and মার্চ.
- If ষান্মাসিক is selected, the summary covers জানুয়ারি–জুন.
- If নয়-মাসিক is selected, the summary covers জানুয়ারি–সেপ্টেম্বর.
- If বার্ষিক is selected, the summary covers all 12 months.

## Dropdown Menu for মাসিক Months (Bangla)
- জানুয়ারি
- ফেব্রুয়ারি
- মার্চ
- এপ্রিল
- মে
- জুন
- জুলাই
- আগস্ট
- সেপ্টেম্বর
- অক্টোবর
- নভেম্বর
- ডিসেম্বর

## Year Dropdown Menu
- 2025
- 2026


# Site Map (Index Format)

- **Login** (`/login`): User authentication page for registered users. Users can log in using either their email or their 3-digit user_id.
- **Register** (`/register`): New user registration form (requires admin approval). System auto-generates a 3-digit user_id for each user.
- **Report Dashboard** (`/`): Main landing page after login for both users and admins.
- **At a Glance** (`/report`): Aggregated/summary report for the selected period. Users see their zone's data (`report.html`); admins see the city level report (`city_report.html`). Includes a download button (Excel/PDF). Available to both users (for their zone) and admins (for the city level report).
- **Report Sections**: Individual forms for each part of the report, matching the database schema:
  - Header Section (`/report/header`): Responsible person, location, and teacher statistics. *(ReportHeader)*
  - Courses Section (`/report/courses`): Educational program details, enrollment, and progress. *(ReportCourse)*
  - Organizational Section (`/report/organizational`): Membership and organizational activities. *(ReportOrganizational)*
  - Personal Section (`/report/personal`): Individual teaching activities. *(ReportPersonal)*
  - Meetings Section (`/report/meetings`): Meeting types and attendance data. *(ReportMeeting)*
  - Extras Section (`/report/extras`): Additional activities and programs. *(ReportExtra)*
  - Comments Section (`/report/comments`): Period-specific narrative comments. *(ReportComment)*
- **Admin Dashboard** (`/`): Admin dashboard provides an overview of all reports and user activities and links to different admin features in a card format. The dashboard view is determined by login role: users see the user dashboard, admins see the admin dashboard.
- **Users Management** (`/users`): Approve/reject users, assign/reassign zones, view user list and status.
- **Zones Management** (`/zones`): Create, delete, and manage zones.
- **All Zone Reports** (`/zone_reports`): View all zone reports filter by report type, month, and year.
- **Help** (`/help`): Help page with frequently asked questions and guidance.
- **Logout** (`/logout`): Log out of the system.

**Notes:**
- All admin/user logic can be handled in `app.py`.
- For a very small user base, keep things simple: avoid unnecessary microservices or over-engineering.
- Use `instance/` for the database and secrets (Flask convention).
- Place all documentation in the root for easy access.
- Static and template folders follow Flask defaults.

---

## 11. Organizational Hierarchy & Reporting Workflow

### Hierarchy Structure
- **City:** The top-level administrative unit. All zones belong to a city.
- **Zone:** Each zone consists of multiple wards. Zone representatives are responsible for collecting and merging ward-level reports, then submitting a consolidated zone report.
- **Ward:** The smallest reporting unit. Ward representatives submit their reports to the zone representative.

### Reporting Flow
1. **Ward Level:** Ward representatives fill out and submit their reports for the selected period.
2. **Zone Level:** Zone representatives review, merge, and finalize ward reports into a single zone report for the period.
3. **City Level:** The system can aggregate all zone reports for a selected period to generate a city-level report, viewable by admins. This aggregation is available via the city report page (`/city_report`).

- **Note:** Only zone reports are directly entered into the system. Ward-level data is merged and summarized by the zone representative before submission. The city report aggregates all zone reports for a comprehensive city-wide summary.
