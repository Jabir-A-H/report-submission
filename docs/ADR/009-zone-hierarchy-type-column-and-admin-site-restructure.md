# ADR-009: Zone Hierarchy (`zone_type` + `parent_id`) & Admin Site Restructure

## Status

Accepted — Pending Implementation

## Date

2026-07-16

## Context

### Zone Identity Problem

During an admin site audit (2026-07-16), it was discovered that **ডি সি এস (DCS — Dhaka City South, zone_id = 1)** was being treated architecturally as a regular reporting zone when it is actually the **city-level administrative entity** whose report is derived by aggregating all underlying zone reports.

Confirmed from legacy Python/Flask system (`legacy/repositories/report_repository.py`): `get_city_aggregated()` fetched ALL reports with no `zone_id` filter, then used pandas `SUM` aggregation across them. There was never a "save totals to zone 1" pattern — DCS has always been the city, not a data-entry zone.

**Problems this caused in the current Next.js system:**

1. All `view_city_*_agg` Postgres views have no `zone_id` filter. If a report exists for `zone_id = 1`, it is included in the city SUM — causing a **self-reference loop** where DCS data inflates the city total.

2. Both admins (superadmin Jabir and admin Jetsky) are assigned `zone_id = 1`. Visiting `/report/[section]?type=monthly&month=7&year=2026` as an admin does **not** check role — it fetches `zone_id` from the admin's profile (1) and auto-creates/opens a DCS zone report with full data-entry forms. This is `WEB-006`.

3. The accidental report `id=36` for zone_id=1, July 2026 was created this way and its (likely empty) data is currently being included in city aggregation.

### Admin Site Fragmentation Problem

The admin area had grown to 7 separate routes with significant duplication:
- **3 dashboards**: `/` (AdminDashboard component), `/admin/dashboard` (KPI analytics page), `/admin/city-report` (aggregated report, acts as a 3rd analytical view)
- **2 report list pages**: `/admin/reports` (simple table) and `/admin/zone-reports` (paginated, filtered — same data, better UI)
- **2 user management pages**: `/admin/users` (full management) and `/admin/approval` (subset of users, approval-only — 100% duplicate)
- **Nav collision**: Root `<Navbar>` and `<BottomNav>` rendered on all `/admin/*` routes simultaneously with the admin sidebar, because no pathname exclusion existed for `/admin`.
- **6+ `useMemo` violations**: `createClient()` called without `useMemo` in every admin page, violating `TECHNICAL_MANUAL.md §1.3`.

### Future Scale Consideration

The system is designed to eventually support a 4-tier organizational hierarchy (City → Zone → Thana → Ward). The current flat `zone` table with only `id` and `name` columns has no structural support for this. Hardcoding `zone_id != 1` in aggregation views would be brittle — a named type system is required.

## Decision Drivers

- DCS must be excluded from zone-level report submission (it is the city, not a zone)
- City aggregation views must exclude DCS to prevent self-reference
- Admin visiting `/report` with DCS selected should see aggregated city data (read-only), not a data-entry form
- Admin visiting `/report/[section]` should be blocked entirely (no data entry for admins)
- The admin UI must be streamlined to 4 necessary pages, no luxury items yet
- Zone hierarchy must be structurally extensible to support future Thana/Ward levels without another migration

## Considered Options

### Zone Architecture

**Option A: Hardcode `zone_id != 1` in views**
- Pros: Zero migration, immediate fix
- Cons: Brittle — breaks if zone table changes; not self-documenting; blocks future hierarchy

**Option B: `zone_type` column only**
- Pros: Clean label, filter views by `zone_type != 'city'`
- Cons: No parent-child relationship — can't represent "which zone does this thana belong to" in the future

**Option C: `zone_type` + `parent_id` (self-referential)**
- Pros: Full hierarchy. Current zones get `parent_id = 1` (DCS). Future wards get `parent_id = <zone_id>`. Aggregation becomes `WHERE parent_id = X` instead of hardcoded IDs. Self-documenting.
- Cons: Slightly more complex zone management UI (parent selector on create)

### Admin Site Structure

**Option A: Keep 7 routes, patch individually**
- Rejected: Addresses symptoms, not the structural problem

**Option B: 4 necessary pages only, no dashboard landing**
- Considered: User requested a dashboard landing be kept as a navigation entry point

**Option C: Simple dashboard landing + 4 tool pages**
- Selected: Dashboard is a navigation card grid (no DB queries, no analytics). 4 tool pages cover all necessary admin functions.

## Decision

### 1. Zone Table: Add `zone_type` + `parent_id`

```sql
ALTER TABLE zone ADD COLUMN zone_type TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'zone';
ALTER TABLE zone ADD COLUMN parent_id INTEGER REFERENCES zone(id);

-- DCS is the city
UPDATE zone SET zone_type = 'city', parent_id = NULL WHERE id = 1;

-- All current zones are children of DCS
UPDATE zone SET zone_type = 'zone', parent_id = 1 WHERE id != 1;
```

**`zone_type` values (current):** `'city'`, `'zone'`
**`zone_type` values (future, names TBD):** `'thana'`, `'ward'`, `'unit'`

Zone type names beyond `'city'` and `'zone'` are not finalized. The column is free-text (not an enum) intentionally so future values can be added without a schema migration.

### 2. Update All `view_city_*_agg` Postgres Views

Replace unconditional joins with a filter that excludes `zone_type = 'city'`:

```sql
-- Example for view_city_header_agg (all 6 views follow same pattern):
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_city_header_agg AS
SELECT r.year, r.month, r.report_type, ...SUM fields...
FROM report r
JOIN report_header rh ON r.id = rh.report_id
JOIN zone z ON r.zone_id = z.id
WHERE z.zone_type != 'city'   -- ← excludes DCS from the sum
GROUP BY r.year, r.month, r.report_type;
```

### 3. Admin Site: 5 Pages (Dashboard Landing + 4 Tool Pages)

**Final admin route map:**

| Route | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| `/admin` | Dashboard landing — 3 navigation cards, no DB queries |
| `/admin/reports` | Paginated, filtered list of all zone-submitted reports |
| `/admin/city-report` | Aggregated city report (read) + inline override editing |
| `/admin/management` | Tab 1: Users (approve/deactivate/reassign/delete) · Tab 2: Zones (add/rename/delete) |

**Deleted routes:** `/admin/dashboard`, `/admin/approval`, `/admin/zone-reports`, `/admin/zones`, `/admin/users`

**Deleted component:** `src/components/dashboard/admin-dashboard.tsx`

### 4. Fix `WEB-006`: Admin Role Guard on `/report/[section]`

Add role check in `src/app/report/[section]/page.tsx` after profile fetch:

```typescript
if (person.role === 'admin' || person.role === 'superadmin') {
  router.replace('/admin');
  return;
}
```

### 5. DCS Zone in `/report` Page: Show Aggregated Data

When an admin selects DCS (zone_type = 'city') in the `/report` zone dropdown:
- Do NOT query `report WHERE zone_id = 1`
- Instead query the `view_city_*_agg` views for the selected period
- Render read-only (no edit buttons, no "go to section" buttons)
- This gives the admin a clean read-only city report view from `/report`, while `/admin/city-report` remains the override-specific page

### 6. Nav Collision Fix

`<Navbar>` and `<BottomNav>` add `pathname.startsWith('/admin')` to their exclusion check. Admin layout adds a `lg:hidden` mobile header with hamburger drawer.

### 7. Root `/` Admin Redirect

`src/app/page.tsx`: when `isAdmin === true`, `redirect('/admin')` instead of rendering `<AdminDashboard />`.

### 8. Clean Up Accidental DCS Report

Delete `report.id = 36` (zone_id=1, July 2026 — accidentally created via admin visiting the data-entry form). Once views exclude `zone_type = 'city'`, this is harmless but should be cleaned up.

## Consequences

### Positive
- DCS is structurally identified as `city` type — no hardcoded IDs anywhere in application code or views
- City aggregation views are self-correcting regardless of which zone_id the city is assigned
- Admin cannot accidentally enter data through the zone manager's data-entry forms
- Future tier expansion (Thana, Ward) requires only new rows in `zone` table with appropriate `zone_type` and `parent_id` — no schema migration needed
- Admin UI is reduced from 7 fragmented routes to 5 clean, purposeful pages
- Nav collision eliminated: public navbar is completely absent from all `/admin/*` routes

### Negative
- Zone management page (`/admin/management` → Zones tab) must show `zone_type` and `parent_id` in its UI, adding minor complexity
- Existing report `id=36` for DCS must be cleaned up manually (one-time operation)
- `view_city_*_agg` all 6 views must be recreated (safe, non-destructive DDL change)

### Risks
- `parent_id` column is self-referential (`REFERENCES zone(id)`). Deleting a parent zone while child zones exist would violate FK constraint. The zone deletion guard (currently checks `user_count > 0`) must also check `child_zone_count > 0`.
- Zone type names (`'thana'`, `'ward'`, etc.) are deferred — the column allows any string. Application code should treat `zone_type != 'city'` as "reportable zone" rather than pattern-matching specific names.

## Implementation Notes

- Delete `report.id = 36` before updating views (to avoid transient inclusion)
- Migration must be an `apply_migration` via Supabase MCP — not applied ad-hoc
- All 6 `view_city_*_agg` views must be updated atomically
- `view_city_course_final` (which wraps `view_city_course_agg`) will automatically pick up the fix since it reads from the base view
